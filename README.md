This is a clone of the SpaceX Website Clone. It is just to practice my skills. But you can contribute to the project, if you want or you see some issues in it.
I'm hosting it to learn about open sourcing a project and web hosting.

## Local Development

With git clone:

```bash
# With HTTPS:
git clone https://github.com/Kunal2007-web/spacex-website-clone.git

# With SSH:

```

or With Github CLI:
