## How to report a bug

To file an issue use the template provided by default by the project.
It will ask the following questions:

1. What kind of bug occurred responsiveness, links not working, etc.?
2. At what screen size did it happen ?
3. What did you expect to happen ?

## Code Review Process

The pull requests are mainly reviewed by the owner on a regular basis. A pull request is reviewed and merged or closed within 2-3 weeks.
Comments will be made on the pull request if the owner wants to merge the request but sees some tiny problems. Sometimes it may take more than 3 weeks to merge or close the request as I am a student.
